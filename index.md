# About SpaceChem
**SpaceChem** is a puzzle game by Zachtronics, which was released in 2011. The plot of the game revolves around SpaceChem, a fictional chemical engineering company dealing with extraction of various more or less real minerals on fictional planets. The player is employed as a **Reaction Engineer Trainee** and is assigned various tasks. Some of them involve chemical reactions inside chemical reactors, while others consist in combining the outputs of several reactors.  
The game reflects the situation of the newly appointed *Reaction Engineer*: the player receives scarce information about the available capabilities of the reactor and has to figure almost everything out on their own. To solve levels, the player uses a visual programming language, which can be learned easily even by beginners who have never programmed before. As the game progresses, the reactors become more advanced and offer more commands so that more complex reactions - i.e. programs - can be developed. After beating a level the player gets a score, which is presented by two parameters: number of cycles used by the program and number of symbols used by the program. The player's score can be compared to the results achieved by other "Engineers" playing the game. Thanks to that the player gets the motivation to improve the program by reducing the number of cycles and/or symbols. In addition, there are additional challenges, which require e.g. beating a level in under a certain number of cycles or with the use of a certain number of reactors.
