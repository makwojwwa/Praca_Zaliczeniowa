# It takes three, Danopth
This is the first tricky level in the whole game because for the first time the player has to overcome a problem, apart from programming the reactor. Namely, the required molecule is composed of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. For this reason one simple loop for each waldo is not a solution - one waldo has to pick up its assigned atoms three times before the required molecule can be created and output. Or has it? Perhaps there is a different option...
# Split before bonding, Danopth
The challenge in this level lies in the quantity of bonders. The player has to remove bonds from two different molecules and then to add new bonds to form the required molecule. So two bonders for the first molecule, two bonders for the second molecule, two bonders to form the new molecule. And we have only four bonders...
# Nothing works, Danopth
Seemingly an ordinary production assignment, where the only trouble is how to distribute the production process between reactors. Unfortunately, this is actually the easiest part: the player quickly realises that there are collisions in one of the reactors, although the waldos are perfectly synchronised. So, the problem must lie elsewhere...
# A most unfortunate malfunction, Danopth
The first defense assignment. It is tricky because before actually starting the program the player does not know what to expect and what to do, because the briefing contains merely hints. And the new (and critical) branch instruction must be operated manually...
